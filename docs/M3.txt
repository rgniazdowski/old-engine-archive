[X] - Script Subsystem initial build + test
[X] - Script - bind most of gui functionality, events, resource
[ ] - Script/particle - make particle effects highly configurable
[ ] - Script - mods, init, resource preload via scripts
[X] - Event - callbacks fix + script callbacks
[X] - Sound - audio/sfx + music loading (res) + sound manager initial
[ ] - Marmalade build sync + fix + device/simulator test
[X] - GFX - Shader request automation + fix
[ ] - GFX - primitives fix / drawcalls - too deep calling route
[ ] - GUI - loading screen / menu control flow fix
[ ] - GUI - custom screen keyboard + joystick emulation
[ ] - GUI - console dropdown for debugging - hook to scripts
[ ] - GUI - finish basic widgets definitions
[ ] - GUI - container free flow fix - widgets cant overlap, relative positioning force
[X] - GUI - special debug mode trigger
[X] - GUI - events fix, callback, script callbacks
[ ] - Logic -initial logic manager / layer
[ ] - Plugins - initial maybe?
[X] - GFX - Scene Manager functional + drawing batch fix
[X] - GFX - AA Bounding Box - initial
[X] - GFX - Initial Frustum class - functional - checking planes works
[ ] - DO - init server, mail, git, cms, two + free
[ ] - APP - need license for device iOS - after 15th maybe
[ ] - APP - need email account / GP account dev?
[ ] - O,X - VPN
[ ] - CFG - app run config working / mod selection
[ ] - TOOLS - some initial tools, any kind for automation
[ ] - TOOLS - need some pkg manager - need to create proper zip file
[ ] - TOOLS - edit marmalade config tool - create distribution/build/package details - this would be nice
[ ] - TOOLS - some wxwidgets layer? need to write some first app with it
[ ] - TOOLS - really, really, really need CMAKE toolchain working on this project
[ ] - PRJ - windows build with VS - simple test, GLEW, SDL2(+SDL2_mixer), GL + windows
[ ] - ZIPFS - need to create some library so loading from one ZIP file would work
		- zlib may be of help, however zip file has also list of file with
		  offsets where to find them in raw stuff

[ ] - OBFS - string obfuscation, need some tool, read xml or ini file, cypher them with some key
		- usage in the code would work with hooking up some automatically
		  generated header file - it would contain just IDS, no string data
		  using #define constants with some IDS - this would work
		  - also to avoid massive project rebuild the file should be separated

[X] - DEPS - remove glbinding dependency (for now)
