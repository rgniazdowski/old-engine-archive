| FLEXI GAME EDITOR
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| BSP BUILDER PREVIEW MODE
+--------------------+

Bsp editor needs to hook up to the update/display and render frames;
Needs also to get keyboard and mouse events.
Hook with 3D scene and camera
Toggle and control additional 3D scene pick selection options
Change properties of the screen grid and debug config
Be able to turn off and on on the fly

BspBuilder holds the internal polygon list
BspBuilder has the instances for BspFile and Compiler
Options to save the tree
Options to load the tree from file

+++ When editing the tree - in fact the tree is not being build
	>> The list of polygons is being populated, simple linear traversion
	>> Compilation + save needs to be explicit

	>> List of materials is created and selected manually (from wx widgets editor level)
	

+++ Ability to switch views - This also changes the grid normal
> LEFT / RIGHT
> TOP / BOTTOM
> FRONT / BACK
> FREE LOOK (GRID Y UP)

+++ Change grid normal manually (angles 0-360 X/Y/Z)

+++ Grid cell size regulation
+++ Snap to grid mode ON / OFF

+++ pick selection of polygons - this needs to be made manually
