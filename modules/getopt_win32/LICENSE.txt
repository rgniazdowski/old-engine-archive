Since  getopt  is  licensed under LGPL,  it  is  free to  use  in proprietary software
under  some restrictions. When using this library as  part  of  a proprietary software
solution, it is important that the library  is used  as  a dynamically  linked library 
(DLL) and is not statically linked or directly compiled into  proprietary source code.
Static linkage requires that your software be released GPL. Therefore,  by keeping the
library  separately  referenced via  Dynamic Link Library (DLL), allows the DLL  to be
modified  and updated  without  changing the proprietary  software  which utilizes the 
library;  under  this  condition  proprietary  software  is said to "use" the library. 
Thus, it is  not  considered  to  be  a  derivative work and can be distributed freely
under any license.
