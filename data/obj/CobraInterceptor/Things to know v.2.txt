
* All models are made by "SolCommand"

* You can use these models for any project you want as long as you give me credit for them and send me a message at "solcommand_pr@yahoo.com" about your project.

* Preview the rest of my models here: http://solcommand.blogspot.com/

* I can also be contacted at "http://the-starport.net/" !

* If you have model requests send me a pm and a cold beer at "the-starport.net" and you might get yourself a new ship, or base or whatever you need.

* If you notice bugs or errors with a model pls let me know so I'd try fix it !

* DO NOT complain about texture quality !!! I get bored fast when texturing so if you want a better texture you can always do one yourself ;)

* That's about it, enjoy them !
